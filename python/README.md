# Python Client - Examples and Code Snippets

This folder contains examples and code snippets for the openEO Python client.

## Overview

Environments: `Python` (plain Python code), `Jupyter` (e.g. Notebooks)

The `Demonstrates` column summarizes the key openEO functionality used in each community example.

| [LoadStac](./LoadStac/)                     | `Jupyter`    | Load an external file in openEO by creating a Stac Item for it. | creating a simple stac item, openEO processes `load_stac` |
| [ParcelDelineation](./ParcelDelineation/)   | `Jupyter` | Delineates parcels with Sentinel-2 data using [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) models. The example focuses on the inference step, using pre-trained models. It demonstrates data loading and preprocessing, inference, post-processing and finally producing vector data as a result. | Selection of best tiles; Running **ONNX models** using `udf`; postprocessing using **sobel filter** and **Felzenszwalb's algoritm** in `udf`, openEO processes `aggregate_spatial`, `build_child_callback`, `filter_labels`, `apply_neighborhood`, `raster_to_vector`, `filter_spatial`|
| [Publishing a UDP (S1 statistics)](./Sentinel1_Stats/) | `Jupyter`   | Computes various statistics for Sentinel-1 data and publishes it as a user-defined process (UDP) that can be re-used by others across multiple languages/environments. | Creating a `udp` with `ProcessBuilder`; Saving `udp`for public reuse with `save_user_defined_process`; Publishing a service; credit usage; openEO processes `rename_labels`, `apply_dimension`, `datacube_from_process` |
